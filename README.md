## Overview

The primary task of this externship project was to complete an initial, exploratory data analysis of the public health records in different regions of Canada to find what may link a business to a greater insurance risk. The original datasets included information on business health inspections, like date, time, business name and address, whether they passed or failed, and any actions that were taken or need to be taken. Any findings or recommendations were then presented to the CEO of Supernova through Google Slides and Zoom.

## The Process

Reviewed and cleaned raw data scraped from different regions' Public Health sites.
